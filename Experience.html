   <span> i would like to tell you guys that I ahve no experience in coding and eah I started coding like this month and yeah i am getting better at it day by day. It would like take me like half a year to master web development and yeah I would also become a Kotlin app developer as well these two would take me 2 years to master and yeah I am learing from tutorails onoine as well as i am googling stuff. So it's a win-win for mee.
